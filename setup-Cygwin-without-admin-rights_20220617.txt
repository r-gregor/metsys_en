Can I install Cygwin without administrator rights?

Yes. The default installation requests administrator rights because this allows to set up the Cygwin
environment so that all users can start a Cygwin shell out of the box. However, if you don't have
administrator rights for your machine, and the admins don't want to install it for you, you can install Cygwin
just for yourself by downloading the Cygwin Setup program, and then start it from the command line or via the
"Run..." dialog from the start menu using the --no-admin option, for instance:

> setup-x86_64.exe --no-admin
