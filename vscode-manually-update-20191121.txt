updating standalone (zip) version ov VSCODE

From the official[https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/windows#_common-questions] doc it says when
downloaded through zip file, one has download the release manually for each update and place the unzip version
inside the Program files (Windows).

According to the special portable[https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/portable] page all the settings,
plugins, etc. of the standalone version are stored in the data-folder. So assuming you called your
vscode-folder vscode:

1 - download the new version
2 - unpack to vscode2 folder adjacent to current vscode
3 - move data folder from vscode to vscode2
4 - delete old vscode-folder
5 - rename vscode2 to vscode
6 - done

P.S.: Current portable versions notify about new version, but clicking on it leads to download, so above list
still applies.
