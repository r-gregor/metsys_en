Vim replace with unicode character

To enter unicode char, you mast enter the x-mode:

   i_CTRL-V
   CTRL-V          Insert next non-digit literally.  For special keys, the
                   terminal code is inserted.  It's also possible to enter the
                   decimal, octal or hexadecimal value of a character
                   i_CTRL-V_digit.
                   The characters typed right after CTRL-V are not considered for
                   mapping.  {Vi: no decimal byte entry}
                   Note: When CTRL-V is mapped (e.g., to paste text) you can
                   often use CTRL-Q instead i_CTRL-Q.

So, to replace ' with Ê¼ you must enter command:
	:s/'/<c-v>u02bc/
