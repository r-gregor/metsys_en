Some software websites provide the AppImage packages for downloading for all Linux users on amd64 (Intel/AMD)
platform.

Ubuntu 22.04 and higher does NOT support AppImage out-of-the-box. User needs to first open terminal
(Ctrl+Alt+T) and run command to enable it:
$> sudo apt install libfuse2

Then, grab the package, add executable permission from file 'Properties' dialog. Finally, click Run to launch
the image editor.
