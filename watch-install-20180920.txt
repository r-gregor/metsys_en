There is watch in cygwin. But it isn't installed by default.
You need to install procps-ng package to appear watch:

$> apt-cyg install procps-ng

kill - Send a signal to a process based on PID
pgrep - List processes based on name or other attributes
pkill - Send a signal to a process based on name or other attributes
