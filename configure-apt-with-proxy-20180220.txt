Configure apt-get internet access via a proxy

(From the forums)

If you are using TKL behind a corporate firewall that requires a proxy to get to the outside world then you'll need to configure apt-get to use a proxy (for installing software via package management, including auto security updates).

It's pretty easy. Just add the apt config using your favourite text editor (instructions for nano but use vim or whatever if you prefer).

nano /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/01turnkey

then insert:

Acquire::http::Proxy "http://your.proxy.here:port/";

Save and exit and you're done! Check that it works with:

apt-get update
