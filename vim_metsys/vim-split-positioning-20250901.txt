How to Vim: Take Control of Split Positioning

   One of my pet peeves with Vim is that by default the buffer splitting behaves a bit weird:
     * horizontal splits (:split) appear on top
     * vertical splits (:vsplit) appear on the left

   That's exactly the opposite of how things happen by default in Emacs (and a few other editors), so it
   really didn't sit well with me. Obviously you can use dedicated commands to control the split
   behavior (e.g. :rightbelow split and :botright vsplit), but if you want to permanently
   "improve" the defaults just add the following your .vimrc:
set splitbelow splitright

   In case it's not clear:
     * splitbelow alters the behavior of :split (and commands like :help that use :split internally)
     * splitright alters the behavior of :vsplit

   And that's it! Now I find using commands like :h a lot more enjoyable, as the help splits appear
   exactly where I expect them to.
