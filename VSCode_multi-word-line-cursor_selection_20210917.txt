Multi-word (and multi-line) cursors/selection in VS Code
Multi-word:

Windows / OS X:

    Ctrl+Shift+L / ⌘+Shift+L selects all instances of the current highlighted word
    Ctrl+D / ⌘+D selects the next instance... and the one after that... etc.

Multi-line:

For multi-line selection, Ctrl+Alt+Down / ⌘+Alt+Shift+Down will extend your selection or cursor position to the next line. Ctrl+Right / ⌘+Right will move to the end of each line, no matter how long. To escape the multi-line selection, hit Esc.
